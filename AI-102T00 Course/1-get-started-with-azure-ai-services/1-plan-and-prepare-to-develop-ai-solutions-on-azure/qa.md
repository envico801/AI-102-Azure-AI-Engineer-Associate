Q:: What is the fundamental goal of Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
A:: To create computer software capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, seeing, understanding language, and making decisions. [Source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/prepare-azure-ai-development/2-what-is-ai)

Q:: How do modern AI systems typically learn, and what is the result of this learning process called?
A:: Modern AI learns by identifying patterns in vast amounts of data. This learned knowledge is stored in a structure called a *model*. [Source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/prepare-azure-ai-development/2-what-is-ai)

Q:: What AI capability focuses on creating *new* content (like text, stories, or code) in response to a user's natural language request, often called a "prompt"?
A:: Generative AI. It acts like a creative assistant, generating novel output based on the input prompt. [Source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/prepare-azure-ai-development/2-what-is-ai)

Q:: How does an AI Agent build upon the capabilities of Generative AI? What key function does it add?
A:: An AI Agent extends Generative AI by not just generating responses but also taking *actions* in the real or digital world based on the user's request (e.g., booking a taxi, not just suggesting one).

Q:: Which AI capability gives computers the ability to interpret and understand information from images and videos, essentially acting like digital "eyes"?
A:: Computer Vision. It allows systems to analyze visual input, like identifying objects in a picture or video feed. [Source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/prepare-azure-ai-development/2-what-is-ai)

Q:: What AI capability involves both understanding human spoken language (speech-to-text) and generating audible responses (text-to-speech)?
A:: Speech. This capability allows computers to function like digital "ears" and a "mouth," enabling voice interaction. [Source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/prepare-azure-ai-development/2-what-is-ai)

Q:: Which AI capability focuses specifically on enabling computers to understand the *meaning*, structure, and intent within human language (written or spoken), going beyond just converting speech to text?
A:: Natural Language Processing (NLP). It's used for tasks like sentiment analysis, language translation, and understanding commands. [Source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/prepare-azure-ai-development/2-what-is-ai)

Q:: What is the primary goal of the Information Extraction AI capability when applied to documents, recordings, or images?
A:: Its primary goal is to automatically identify and pull out specific, important pieces of information (like dates, names, totals, keywords) from unstructured or semi-structured data sources. [Source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/prepare-azure-ai-development/2-what-is-ai)

Q:: How does the Decision Support AI capability typically use past data, and what is its main purpose?
A:: It analyzes historical data to identify patterns and make predictions about future outcomes, aiming to help humans make more informed and better decisions. [Source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/prepare-azure-ai-development/2-what-is-ai)

Q:: If an AI system analyzes customer reviews to determine if they are generally positive or negative, which core AI capability is primarily being used?
A:: Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically a technique often called sentiment analysis. [Source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/prepare-azure-ai-development/2-what-is-ai)
