###### ID120

A:: =============================================  
___

1. Use Azure Custom Vision to train an object detection model.

Using Azure Custom Vision to train an object detection model is the optimal choice because it meets the requirements for identifying and locating animals in wildlife images. Building a CNN model by using Azure Machine Learning is resource-intensive and unnecessary given the availability of Azure Custom Vision. Training a classification model by using Azure Custom Vision does not provide localization information, which is essential for this task. Using the prebuilt image tagging model in Azure AI Vision lacks customization and localization capabilities, making it unsuitable for this scenario.\

###### ID192

A:: =============================================  
___

1. Define tools for API access.

2. Deploy the agent using Azure SDK.

3. Configure the Bing Search tool.

Defining tools for API access ensures the agent can interact with external APIs effectively. Deploying the agent using Azure SDK makes it operational within the Azure environment, enabling API interactions. Configuring the Bing Search tool enables the agent to access real-time data. Setting up an Azure AI Search resource is optional and does not directly contribute to enabling API interaction for the agent. Manually parsing API responses is unnecessary because Azure AI Foundry Agent Service automates tool calling and response handling. Using Blob Storage for conversation state is unnecessary because Azure AI Foundry Agent Service manages conversation state through threads.

Converting the documents into plain text results in the loss of structural information, which is essential for extracting meaningful data. Training a custom model using labeled datasets in Azure AI Document Intelligence enables accurate extraction of data from unique forms that do not conform to standard templates. The General Document model is deprecated and not recommended for use in new solutions, making it unsuitable for this task. The Layout model can extract text and structure but is not optimized for specific document types like invoices or receipts, which limits its effectiveness for this scenario. The prebuilt Invoice model in Azure AI Document Intelligence is specifically designed to extract key information from invoices, making it an appropriate choice for this task.

- Export the model for local use.
- Publish the model and retrieve its Prediction URL and key.
- Re-train the model with additional data.


###### ID207

A:: =============================================  
___

1. Publish the model and retrieve its Prediction URL and key.

Publishing the trained iteration and retrieving its Prediction URL and key is the appropriate action to make the model accessible for programmatic predictions in a production environment. Exporting the model for local use is not aligned with the goal of leveraging the Microsoft Azure Custom Vision Prediction API. Re-training the model is unnecessary as the current performance metrics are satisfactory and does not contribute to the deployment process. Creating a new Azure resource is unrelated to the task of deploying the trained model and does not address the stated goal.

[Create a client application that uses an image generation model - Training | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/generate-images-azure-openai/4-dall-e-rest-api)

Q:: =============================================  

##### You are developing a custom vision model using Microsoft Custom Vision to classify images of various plant species. A subset of the dataset has already been labeled, and an initial iteration of the model has been trained.

You need to efficiently improve the model's accuracy by optimizing the labeling process for the remaining untagged images.

Each correct answer presents part of the solution. Which three actions should you perform?

Select all answers that apply.

- Delete all previously tagged images.
- Manually label all images from scratch.
- Prioritize reviewing tags with high prediction uncertainty.
- Review and confirm suggested tags for each image.
- Train the model without reviewing tags.
- Use Smart Labeler to suggest tags for untagged images.


###### ID208

A:: =============================================  
___

1. Prioritize reviewing tags with high prediction uncertainty.

2. Review and confirm suggested tags for each image.

3. Use Smart Labeler to suggest tags for untagged images.

To optimize the labeling process and improve the model's accuracy, it is essential to review and confirm suggested tags to ensure data reliability. Prioritizing tags with high prediction uncertainty helps address ambiguous cases effectively, while using the Smart Labeler streamlines the process by leveraging the model's existing capabilities. Deleting previously tagged images would result in the loss of valuable data, training the model without reviewing tags could propagate errors, and manually labeling all images from scratch is inefficient and disregards the benefits of automation.

Q:: =============================================  

##### You are building an app that will use Azure AI Vision to analyze and classify images to build an image library of animals.

You need to configure the classification type for the Azure AI Vision project. The solution must ensure that the images selected only include a single animal.

Which type of classification should you use?

Select only one answer.

- multiclass
- multilabel
- singleclass
- singlelabel
- unilabel


###### ID209

A:: =============================================  
___

1. multiclass

Multilabel classification applies any number of tags to an image (zero or more), while multiclass classification sorts images into single categories (every image you submit will be sorted into the most likely tag). Therefore, using multilabel means that one image can be tagged as both “cat” and “dog” at the same time, although it should be either/or.

- Select the Read model.
- Use low-quality images.
- Use text-based PDF files.


###### ID217

A:: =============================================  
___

1. Ensure input files meet required specifications.

2. Select the Invoice model.

3. Use text-based PDF files.

Meeting input requirements, such as file format and resolution, is essential for optimal data extraction performance. Text-embedded PDFs eliminate errors in character recognition, enhancing the accuracy of data extraction and optimizing the OCR process for structured data extraction. The Microsoft Invoice model is specifically trained to extract structured data from invoices, including fields like invoice number and total amount, directly addressing the requirement for structured data extraction from invoices. Low-resolution images reduce the accuracy of data extraction, making them unsuitable for this task. The Microsoft Business Card model is tailored for extracting data from business cards, not invoices, and does not align with the goal of extracting structured data from invoices. The Microsoft Read model is designed for general text extraction and does not specialize in structured data extraction from invoices, failing to meet the specific requirements of the task.

- Include an access token in the Authorization header.


###### ID220

A:: =============================================  
___

1. Grant access to a specific virtual network.

If you enable the firewall for the Azure AI Services account, you need to allow network access to the service. You can achieve this by either allowing access from a specific virtual network or adding an IP range to the firewall rules. In this situation, the app is deployed to a virtual machine in Azure, which resides in a virtual network. You can provide access to virtual networks in Azure to access specific service endpoints.

What should you do?

Select only one answer.

- Create a secret and store the secret in an Azure key vault. Assign App1 role-based access control (RBAC) permissions to the secret.
- Create a Microsoft Entra app registration and enable certificate-based authentication.
- From App1, enable a managed identity and assign role-based access control (RBAC) permissions to Azure AI Services.
- From PowerShell, create a secret that never expires.


###### ID221

A:: =============================================  
___

1. From App1, enable a managed identity and assign role-based access control (RBAC) permissions to Azure AI Services.

With a managed identity, the rotation of the secrets (certificates) is done automatically.
You still need to rotate secrets by using the key vault, and you cannot create secrets that never expire from the portal. It is not considered best practice to create one with PS1 or the CLI, and a certificate will also expire at some point.

###### ID226

A:: =============================================  
___

1. Azure AI Search

Azure OpenAI on your data enables developers to use supported AI chat models that can reference specific sources of information to ground the response. Adding this information allows the model to reference both the specific data provided and its pretrained knowledge to provide more effective responses. Azure OpenAI on your data utilizes the search ability of Azure AI Search to add the relevant data chunks to a prompt.
Azure OpenAI on your data still uses a stateless API to connect to the model, which removes the requirement of training a custom model with your data and simplifies the interaction with the AI model. Cognitive Search first finds the useful information to answer the prompt, and Azure OpenAI forms the response based on that information.

Q:: =============================================  

##### You are building a multilingual conversational app by using Conversational Language Understanding (CLU), part of Azure AI Language service.

You create a CLU model that will serve multiple languages.

You need to optimize the performance of the model. The solution must minimize development effort.

What should you do?

Select only one answer.

- Add utterances for languages that are performing poorly in the model.
- Configure the app to only query utterances in the language that was used to train the model.
- Create separate projects for each language.
- Train the model by using utterances in multiple languages and only query the model by using the project language.


###### ID229

A:: =============================================  
___

1. Add utterances for languages that are performing poorly in the model.

With CLU, there is no need to use multiple projects for a model. For example, you can train a model in English and query it in German. There is no project language, therefore, adding utterances for languages in the model that are performing poorly is the appropriate solution to increase performance.

Q:: =============================================  

##### Your company needs to analyze images of retail shelves to identify product placement and stock levels.

You need to implement a Microsoft Azure AI solution to analyze these images.

What should you use?

Select only one answer.

- Train an Azure AI Custom Vision model.
- Use Azure AI Content Understanding.
- Use an Azure AI Vision prebuilt model.
- Use an Azure AI Foundry GPT model.


###### ID231

A:: =============================================  
___

1. Use Azure AI Content Understanding.

Azure AI Content Understanding is the most appropriate solution as it is specifically designed to analyze images and extract structured data, such as product counts, directly addressing the requirements. Training a Custom Vision model would require additional effort and resources without providing any significant advantage over the existing capabilities of Azure AI Content Understanding. Prebuilt Azure AI Vision models can detect bounding boxes but does not offer the ability to count or extract structured data about products, making it unsuitable for this task. Azure AI Foundry GPT models can provide information based on provided data or information but is unable to achieve the desired result on its own.

Q:: =============================================  

##### You build an app named App1 that uses the Azure AI Face service.

You need to optimize the app for images that contain blurry faces.

What should you do?

Select only one answer.

- Change the recognition model to `recognition_02`.
- Decrease the `faceIdTimeToLive` value.
- Set the detection model to `detection_03`.


###### ID232

A:: =============================================  
___

1. Set the detection model to `detection_03`.

Model_3 Improves accuracy on small, side-view, and blurry faces.
