========== Question ==========  

### Your company uses an Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models service to generate images based on text prompts.

You need to configure the API request to ensure optimized image quality and resolution.

Each correct answer presents part of the solution. Which two actions should you take?

Select all answers that apply.

-   Set 'n' to 10.

-   Set 'output_format' to JPEG.

-   Set 'quality' to hd.

-   Specify 'size' as 1024x1792.  

========== Answer ==========  

---

###### 1. Set 'quality' to hd.

###### 2. Specify 'size' as 1024x1792.

To optimize image quality and resolution, 'quality' should be set to hd to ensure finer details and better consistency, and 'size' should be specified as 1024x1792 to meet the required resolution. Setting 'n' only determines the number of images generated and does not impact quality or resolution. Configuring 'output_format' affects the image format but does not influence image quality or resolution.
