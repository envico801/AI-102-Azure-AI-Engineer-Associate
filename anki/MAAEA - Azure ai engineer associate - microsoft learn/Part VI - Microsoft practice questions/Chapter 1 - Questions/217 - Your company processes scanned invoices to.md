========== Answer ==========

###### 1. Ensure input files meet required specifications.

###### 2. Select the Invoice model.

###### 3. Use text-based PDF files.

Meeting input requirements, such as file format and resolution, is essential for optimal data extraction performance. Text-embedded PDFs eliminate errors in character recognition, enhancing the accuracy of data extraction and optimizing the OCR process for structured data extraction. The Microsoft Invoice model is specifically trained to extract structured data from invoices, including fields like invoice number and total amount, directly addressing the requirement for structured data extraction from invoices. Low-resolution images reduce the accuracy of data extraction, making them unsuitable for this task. The Microsoft Business Card model is tailored for extracting data from business cards, not invoices, and does not align with the goal of extracting structured data from invoices. The Microsoft Read model is designed for general text extraction and does not specialize in structured data extraction from invoices, failing to meet the specific requirements of the task.
