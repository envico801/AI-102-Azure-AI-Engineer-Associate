========== Question ==========  

### Your organization is developing a customer-facing application that uses Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models to generate personalized responses. The application is connected to a Microsoft Azure AI Search index.

You need to configure the application to retrieve relevant data from the search index.

What should you do?

Select only one answer.

-   Deploy an additional Azure OpenAI model.

-   Enable semantic search.

-   Increase chunk size for data ingestion.

-   Use keyword search.  

========== Answer ==========

###### 1. Enable semantic search.

Enabling semantic search enhances the precision and relevance of search results by interpreting the meaning behind query terms, making it the most suitable solution for improving response accuracy in this scenario. Increasing chunk size impacts data processing but does not directly affect the accuracy of retrieved data. Deploying an additional Azure OpenAI model does not address the specific need for improving data retrieval accuracy from the search index. Using keyword search lacks semantic capabilities, which are essential for achieving the desired level of accuracy.
