========== Question ==========  

### Your company uses an Azure OpenAI Foundry Models service to generate code snippets for software development.

You need to ensure the generated code adheres to your organization's coding standards.

What action should you take to achieve this?

Select only one answer.

-   Enable multi-region deployment.

-   Increase compute resources.

-   Provide standard-compliant examples in prompts.

-   Switch to a chat-optimized model.  

========== Answer ==========

###### 1. Provide standard-compliant examples in prompts.

Providing examples of code adhering to standards in the input prompts ensures the AI model generates code that aligns with those standards, addressing the issue effectively. Enabling multi-region deployment enhances availability and resilience but does not impact code adherence to standards. Increasing compute resources may improve processing speed but does not affect code adherence to standards. Models optimized for chat-based interactions are not specifically designed to improve code adherence to standards.
