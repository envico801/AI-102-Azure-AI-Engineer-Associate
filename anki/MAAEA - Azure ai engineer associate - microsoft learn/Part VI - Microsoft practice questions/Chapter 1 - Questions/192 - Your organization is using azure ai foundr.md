========== Question ==========  

### Your organization is using Azure AI Foundry Agent Service to automate customer support workflows.

You need to configure an agent to interact with external APIs and use real-time data for responses.

Each correct answer presents part of the solution. Which three actions should you perform?

Select all answers that apply.

-   Define tools for API access.

-   Deploy the agent using Azure SDK.

-   Manually parse API responses in code.

-   Configure the Bing Search tool.

-   Set up an Azure AI Search resource.

-   Use Blob Storage for conversation state.  

========== Answer ==========  

---

###### 1. Define tools for API access.

###### 2. Deploy the agent using Azure SDK.

###### 3. Configure the Bing Search tool.

Defining tools for API access ensures the agent can interact with external APIs effectively. Deploying the agent using Azure SDK makes it operational within the Azure environment, enabling API interactions. Configuring the Bing Search tool enables the agent to access real-time data. Setting up an Azure AI Search resource is optional and does not directly contribute to enabling API interaction for the agent. Manually parsing API responses is unnecessary because Azure AI Foundry Agent Service automates tool calling and response handling. Using Blob Storage for conversation state is unnecessary because Azure AI Foundry Agent Service manages conversation state through threads.
