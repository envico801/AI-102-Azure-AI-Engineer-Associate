========== Question ==========  

### Your organization plans to develop an AI solution using Microsoft Azure AI Foundry Agent Service to automate customer support workflows.

Select all answers that apply.

-   Add Bing search tools in the agent configuration.

-   Configure Azure Functions in the agent configuration file.

========== Answer ==========

###### 1. Add Bing search tools in the agent configuration.

###### 2. Configure Azure Functions in the agent configuration file.

Adding Bing search tools enables the agent to retrieve relevant information from external sources, enhancing its ability to respond accurately to user queries. Configuring Azure Functions allows the agent to execute specific actions programmatically, which is crucial for automating workflows based on user inputs. Deploying a containerized image is not necessary to configure the agent's capabilities. Setting up a SQL database is not required for configuring the agent's interaction capabilities, as it does not directly contribute to the goal of automating customer support workflows. Using Computer Vision is unrelated to the task of configuring the agent for customer support workflows, as it focuses on image analysis rather than interaction with external data sources.
