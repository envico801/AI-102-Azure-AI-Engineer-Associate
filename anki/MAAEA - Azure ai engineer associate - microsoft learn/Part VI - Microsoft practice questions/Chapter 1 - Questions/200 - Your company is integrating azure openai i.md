========== Answer ==========

###### 1. Set strictness to a higher value.

Setting strictness to a higher value ensures that only the most relevant documents are retrieved, effectively prioritizing relevance during data retrieval. Enabling hybrid search mode combines different search methods but does not specifically focus on document relevance. Increasing the number of retrieved documents may include less relevant data, which contradicts the goal of prioritizing relevance. Reducing chunk size impacts data granularity but does not directly influence the prioritization of document relevance.
