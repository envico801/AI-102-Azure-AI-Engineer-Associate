========== Question ==========  

### You have a question answering project.

A customer asks a question that is not part of the project.

You review the active learning suggestions and do not see any suggestions.

You need to ensure that customer questions are included in the active learning suggestions. The solution must minimize administrative effort.

What should you do?

Select only one answer.

-   Add the customer questions to the editor manually.

-   Configure active learning.

-   Enable logging for the project.

-   Wait at least 30 minutes before checking for suggestions.  

========== Answer ==========

###### 1. Wait at least 30 minutes before checking for suggestions.

Active learning suggestions are not in real time. There is an approximate delay of 30 minutes before suggestions show on this pane. This delay balances the high cost involved in real-time updates to the index and service performance.

Active learning is turned on by default. You can use active learning for this instead of manually logging the questions and adding them.
