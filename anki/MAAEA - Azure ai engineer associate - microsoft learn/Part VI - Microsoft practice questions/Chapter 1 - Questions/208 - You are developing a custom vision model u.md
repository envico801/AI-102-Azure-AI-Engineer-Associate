========== Question ==========  

### You are developing a custom vision model using Microsoft Custom Vision to classify images of various plant species. A subset of the dataset has already been labeled, and an initial iteration of the model has been trained.

You need to efficiently improve the model's accuracy by optimizing the labeling process for the remaining untagged images.

Each correct answer presents part of the solution. Which three actions should you perform?

Select all answers that apply.

-   Delete all previously tagged images.

-   Manually label all images from scratch.

-   Prioritize reviewing tags with high prediction uncertainty.

-   Review and confirm suggested tags for each image.

-   Train the model without reviewing tags.

-   Use Smart Labeler to suggest tags for untagged images.  

========== Answer ==========

###### 1. Prioritize reviewing tags with high prediction uncertainty.

###### 2. Review and confirm suggested tags for each image.

###### 3. Use Smart Labeler to suggest tags for untagged images.

To optimize the labeling process and improve the model's accuracy, it is essential to review and confirm suggested tags to ensure data reliability. Prioritizing tags with high prediction uncertainty helps address ambiguous cases effectively, while using the Smart Labeler streamlines the process by leveraging the model's existing capabilities. Deleting previously tagged images would result in the loss of valuable data, training the model without reviewing tags could propagate errors, and manually labeling all images from scratch is inefficient and disregards the benefits of automation.
