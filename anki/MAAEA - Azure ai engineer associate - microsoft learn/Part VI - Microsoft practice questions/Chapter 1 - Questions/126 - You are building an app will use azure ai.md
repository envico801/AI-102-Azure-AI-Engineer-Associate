###### 1. document cracking

Document cracking is the process of opening files and extracting content. It is the first stage of the indexing process.

Text-based content can be extracted from files in a service, rows in a table, or items in a container or collection. If you add a skillset and image skills, document cracking can also extract images and queue them for image processing.
