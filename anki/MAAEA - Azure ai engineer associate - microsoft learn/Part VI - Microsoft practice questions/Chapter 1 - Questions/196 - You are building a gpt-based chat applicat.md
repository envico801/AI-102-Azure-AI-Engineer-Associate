========== Question ==========  

### You are building a GPT-based chat application that will answer questions about your company.

You plan to test the application by using strategies defined by Microsoft best practices.

Which three prompt engineering strategies should you consider while testing the application? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

Select all answers that apply.

-   Be Descriptive

-   Be minimalistic

-   Be simple

-   Be Specific

-   Order Matters  

========== Answer ==========  

---

###### 1. Be Descriptive

###### 2. Be Specific

###### 3. Order Matters

Be Specific means to leave as little to interpretation as possible. Be Descriptive means to use analogies. Order Matters means that the order in which you present information to the model can affect the output. Therefore, those three are valid best practices. Be simple and be minimalistic do not produce the best results and are, therefore, not best practices
