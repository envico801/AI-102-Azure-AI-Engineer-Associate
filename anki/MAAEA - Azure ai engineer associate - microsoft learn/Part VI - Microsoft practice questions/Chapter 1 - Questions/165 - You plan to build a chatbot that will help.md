Which three scenarios should you identify? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

Select all answers that apply.

-   when you have a bot conversation that includes static information

-   when you have dynamic information in a knowledge base of answers

-   when you have static information in a knowledge base of answers

-   when you need to provide the same answer to a request, question, or command

###### 1. when you have a bot conversation that includes static information

###### 2. when you have static information in a knowledge base of answers

###### 3. when you need to provide the same answer to a request, question, or command

Question answering only works with static information, not with dynamic information. In addition, it will always provide the same answer to the same question.
