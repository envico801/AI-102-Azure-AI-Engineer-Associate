========== Question ==========  

### You are building an app that will recognize the intent and entities of user utterances in real-time.

You are evaluating the use of intent recognition with the Azure AI Speech and Azure AI Language services or simple pattern matching.

When should you use pattern matching?

Select only one answer.

-   You are only interested in matching strictly what the user said.

-   You must manage the model by using a web app.

-   You must use a machine learned entity.

-   You must use a prebuilt entity.  

========== Answer ==========

###### 1. You are only interested in matching strictly what the user said.

The only option is to use pattern matching over Language Understanding when you want to strictly match what a user said, as the incorrect options are only available in Language Understanding.
