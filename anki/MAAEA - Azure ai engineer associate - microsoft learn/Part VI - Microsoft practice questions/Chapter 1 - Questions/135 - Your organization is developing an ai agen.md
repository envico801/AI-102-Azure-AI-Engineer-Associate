###### 1. Semantic Kernel framework

Azure Bot Framework is commonly used for building conversational bots but does not provide the orchestration features required for multi-agent workflows. Azure Machine Learning Studio is focused on developing machine learning models and does not address the need for orchestration in this scenario. Cognitive Services API offers pre-built AI functionalities but lacks the ability to orchestrate multi-agent workflows. Semantic Kernel framework is the most suitable choice as it supports generative AI orchestration and multi-agent workflows, aligning perfectly with the requirements of the scenario.
