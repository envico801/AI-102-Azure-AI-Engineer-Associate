========== Question ==========  

### Your company is deploying a generative AI model using Microsoft Azure AI Foundry Service to assist customer support agents by providing suggested responses to user queries.

You need to ensure the model generates outputs that are safe and free from harmful content.

Each correct answer presents part of the solution. Which three actions should you take?

Select all answers that apply.

-   Conduct red team exercises to test vulnerabilities.

-   Document the model's decision-making logic.

-   Enable users to provide feedback on responses.

-   Integrate Azure AI Foundry Content Safety APIs.

-   Train the model exclusively on synthetic data.  

========== Answer ==========  

---

###### 1. Conduct red team exercises to test vulnerabilities.

###### 2. Document the model's decision-making logic.

###### 3. Integrate Azure AI Foundry Content Safety APIs.

Conducting red team exercises helps identify vulnerabilities and improve the model's robustness against manipulation. This enhances the security and reliability of the AI system. Documenting the model's decision-making logic provides transparency and supports explainability requirements. This aligns with Responsible AI principles and addresses legal implications. Enabling users to provide feedback on every response may overwhelm users and does not directly address the goal of ensuring content safety. Integrating Azure AI Foundry Content Safety APIs helps identify and filter harmful content in real-time, ensuring the safety and appropriateness of the model's outputs. Training the model exclusively on synthetic data may limit its ability to generate realistic and contextually appropriate responses, reducing its effectiveness.
