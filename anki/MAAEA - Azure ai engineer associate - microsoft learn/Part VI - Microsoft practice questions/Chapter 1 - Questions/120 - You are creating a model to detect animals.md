========== Question ==========  

### You are creating a model to detect animals in wildlife images.

You need to train a model that identifies and locates animals efficiently.

What should you use?

Select only one answer.

-   Build a CNN model by using Azure Machine Learning.

-   Train a classification model by using Azure Custom Vision.

-   Use Azure Custom Vision to train an object detection model.

-   Use the prebuilt image tagging model in Azure AI Vision.  

========== Answer ==========

###### 1. Use Azure Custom Vision to train an object detection model.

Using Azure Custom Vision to train an object detection model is the optimal choice because it meets the requirements for identifying and locating animals in wildlife images. Building a CNN model by using Azure Machine Learning is resource-intensive and unnecessary given the availability of Azure Custom Vision. Training a classification model by using Azure Custom Vision does not provide localization information, which is essential for this task. Using the prebuilt image tagging model in Azure AI Vision lacks customization and localization capabilities, making it unsuitable for this scenario.\
