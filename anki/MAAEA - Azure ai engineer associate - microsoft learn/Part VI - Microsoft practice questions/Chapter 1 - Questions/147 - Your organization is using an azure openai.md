========== Question ==========  

### Your organization is using an Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models service for document summarization across various document types.

You need to ensure the AI generates summaries that meet organizational requirements.

What action should you take to achieve this?

Select only one answer.

-   Enable diagnostic logging.

-   Increase the token limit.

-   Refine prompts to specify key details.

-   Switch to a higher-cost model.  

========== Answer ==========

###### 1. Refine prompts to specify key details.

Refining prompts to specify key details ensures the AI model generates concise and relevant summaries, directly addressing the optimization requirement. Enabling diagnostic logging provides insights into system performance but does not impact the quality of generated summaries. Increasing the token limit allows for longer responses but does not inherently improve quality. Switching to a higher-cost model may enhance performance but does not guarantee better summaries without prompt optimization.
