========== Question ==========  

### Your organization has trained a custom vision model using Microsoft Azure Custom Vision to classify product images. The model has satisfactory performance metrics.

You need to make the model available for predictions in a production environment.

What should you do next?

Select only one answer.

-   Create a new Azure resource for the model.

-   Export the model for local use.

-   Publish the model and retrieve its Prediction URL and key.

-   Re-train the model with additional data.  

========== Answer ==========

###### 1. Publish the model and retrieve its Prediction URL and key.

Publishing the trained iteration and retrieving its Prediction URL and key is the appropriate action to make the model accessible for programmatic predictions in a production environment. Exporting the model for local use is not aligned with the goal of leveraging the Microsoft Azure Custom Vision Prediction API. Re-training the model is unnecessary as the current performance metrics are satisfactory and does not contribute to the deployment process. Creating a new Azure resource is unrelated to the task of deploying the trained model and does not address the stated goal.
