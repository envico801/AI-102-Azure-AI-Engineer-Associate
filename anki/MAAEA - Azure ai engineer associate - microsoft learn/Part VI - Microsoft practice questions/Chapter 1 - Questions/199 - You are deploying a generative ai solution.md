========== Question ==========  

### You are deploying a generative AI solution using an Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models service to process customer feedback and generate summaries.

You need to optimize the solution for performance and ensure its responses align with the organization's tone and style.

Each correct answer presents part of the solution. Which three actions should you perform?

Select all answers that apply.

-   Deploy the model on edge devices.

-   Enable support for multiple languages.

-   Fine-tune the model with customer feedback data.

-   Set up monitoring in Azure to track response accuracy and resource usage.

-   Use prompt engineering to refine the model's output.  

========== Answer ==========  

---

###### 1. Fine-tune the model with customer feedback data.

###### 2. Set up monitoring in Azure to track response accuracy and resource usage.

###### 3. Use prompt engineering to refine the model's output.

To optimize the generative AI solution for performance and ensure its responses align with the organization's tone and style, it is essential to set up monitoring in Azure to continuously evaluate the model's performance and resource usage. Fine-tuning the model with customer feedback data customizes the solution to meet specific organizational requirements, ensuring alignment with tone and style. Additionally, using prompt engineering refines the model's responses by structuring input effectively, enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated content. Deploying the model on edge devices and enabling support for multiple languages do not directly address the stated goals, as they focus on deployment strategy and additional features rather than performance optimization or alignment with tone and style.
