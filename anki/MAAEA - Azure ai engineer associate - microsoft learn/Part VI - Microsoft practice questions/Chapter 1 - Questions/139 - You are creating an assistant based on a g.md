========== Question ==========  

### You are creating an assistant based on a generative Azure AI model.

You plan to use the system message component for prompts in the solution.

Which two capabilities does the system message offer for the model? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

Select all answers that apply.

-   defines the data sources that should not be included in the model

-   defines what the model should and should not do

-   detects which language is being used in a prompt

-   helps define the assistant’s personality  

========== Answer ==========  

---

###### 1. defines what the model should and should not do

###### 2. helps define the assistant’s personality

The system message is included at the beginning of the prompt and is used to prime the model with context, instructions, or other information relevant to the use case. You can use the system message to describe the assistant’s personality, define what the model should and should not answer, and define the format of model responses.
