========== Question ==========  

### Your team is deploying an AI agent to perform actions based on user requests, such as scheduling meetings and sending notifications.

You need to integrate the AI agent with tools that enable it to perform these actions programmatically.

What should you do?

Select only one answer.

-   Add custom functions.

-   Configure static templates.

-   Enable default model capabilities.

-   Use a pre-trained chatbot framework.  

========== Answer ==========

###### 1. Add custom functions.

Adding custom functions enables the AI agent to dynamically execute specific actions such as scheduling meetings and sending notifications, making it the most suitable choice for the scenario. Configuring static templates does not provide the flexibility needed for dynamic action execution, limiting its effectiveness. Default model capabilities lack the ability to perform specific programmatic actions, making them insufficient for the task. Using a pre-trained chatbot framework without customization fails to address the specific requirements for executing actions programmatically, reducing its applicability in this context.
