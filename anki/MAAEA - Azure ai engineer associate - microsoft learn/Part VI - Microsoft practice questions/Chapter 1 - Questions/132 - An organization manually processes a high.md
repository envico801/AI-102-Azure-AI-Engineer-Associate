========== Question ==========  

### An organization manually processes a high volume of invoices daily, leading to errors in data extraction.

You need to use Microsoft Azure AI Document Intelligence to automate invoice data extraction and integration.

Each correct answer presents part of the solution. Which two actions should you take?

Select all answers that apply.

-   Integrate the extracted data with an organization's database.

-   Train a custom model for document processing.

-   Use a general-purpose model for text extraction.

-   Use the prebuilt Invoice model for data extraction.  

========== Answer ==========  

---

###### 1. Integrate the extracted data with an organization's database.

###### 2. Use the prebuilt Invoice model for data extraction.

Integrating the extracted data with an organization's database ensures the information is stored and used effectively within existing systems, supporting downstream processes and workflows. Using the prebuilt Invoice model for data extraction is ideal because it is specifically designed to handle invoice documents, extracting structured data such as key-value pairs and tables efficiently. Training a custom model for document processing is unnecessary in this scenario since the prebuilt Invoice model meets the requirements for standard invoices. Using a general-purpose model for text extraction does not align with the goal of extracting structured data from invoices, as it lacks the specificity required for this task.
