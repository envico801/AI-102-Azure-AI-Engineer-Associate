========== Question ==========  

### Your organization is developing an AI agent to assist with document retrieval and analysis using Microsoft Azure services.

You need to enable the AI agent to access external data sources for processing documents.

What should you use?

Select only one answer.

-   Configure a custom model in Azure Machine Learning.

-   Enable default capabilities in Azure Document Intelligence.

-   Use Azure AI Vision Service.

-   Use Azure AI Search with built-in skills.  

========== Answer ==========

###### 1. Use Azure AI Search with built-in skills.

Azure AI Search is the most suitable solution because it provides the required functionality for accessing and analyzing external documents with built-in skills, which aligns with the scenario's needs. Configuring a custom model in Azure Machine Learning focuses on document analysis but does not address the retrieval aspect, making it unsuitable. Enabling default capabilities in Azure Document Intelligence lacks the specific retrieval functionality needed for the task. Azure AI Vision Service can perform OCR but is not well suited for document processing and lacks the retrieval aspect.
