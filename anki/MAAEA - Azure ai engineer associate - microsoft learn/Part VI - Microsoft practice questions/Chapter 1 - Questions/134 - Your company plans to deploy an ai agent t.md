###### 1. Azure AI Language.

Azure AI Language is the most appropriate service for this scenario as it specializes in analyzing and deriving insights from natural language text, directly addressing the requirements for text analysis. Azure AI Speech is not suitable because it focuses on audio transformations such as speech-to-text and text-to-speech, which are unrelated to the task. Azure AI Translator is designed for translating text between languages and does not provide the necessary capabilities for analyzing and generating insights from text. Azure AI Vision is focused on image-related tasks and lacks the functionality required for processing natural language text.
