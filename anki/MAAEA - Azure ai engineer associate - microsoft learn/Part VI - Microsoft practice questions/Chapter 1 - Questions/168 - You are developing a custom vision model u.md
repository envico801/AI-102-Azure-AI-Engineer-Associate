========== Question ==========  

### You are developing a custom vision model using Microsoft Azure AI Custom Vision to detect specific objects in images. The dataset includes labeled images for training and validation.

You need to ensure that the trained model meets the required accuracy by assessing its performance.

What action should you take?

Select only one answer.

-   Deploy the model without testing.

-   Evaluate precision and recall metrics.

-   Source new images for testing.

-   Retrain the model with a new dataset.  

========== Answer ==========

###### 1. Evaluate precision and recall metrics.

Evaluating precision and recall metrics is the most effective way to assess the performance of an object detection model, as these metrics provide a detailed understanding of its accuracy and ability to identify objects correctly. Deploying the model without testing bypasses the critical step of ensuring its reliability and effectiveness. Sourcing new images for testing isn't necessary with a dataset already containing validation images. Retraining the model with a new dataset focuses on improving data quality rather than assessing the current model's performance, making it unsuitable for the given objective.
