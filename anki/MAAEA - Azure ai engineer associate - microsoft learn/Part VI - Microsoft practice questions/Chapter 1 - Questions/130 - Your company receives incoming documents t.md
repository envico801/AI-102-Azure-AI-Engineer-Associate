###### 1. Custom classification model in Azure AI Document Intelligence

The custom classification model in Azure AI Document Intelligence is the most suitable solution because it is specifically designed to categorize documents into predefined categories, enabling accurate classification and supporting subsequent data extraction. Custom template models are limited to data extraction from structured documents and do not address classification needs. Azure AI Vision OCR focuses solely on text recognition and lacks the functionality required for document categorization. The Invoice model is tailored for invoice processing and does not meet the broader requirements for document classification described in the scenario.
