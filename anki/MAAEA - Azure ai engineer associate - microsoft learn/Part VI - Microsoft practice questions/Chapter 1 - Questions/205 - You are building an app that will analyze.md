###### 1. Speaker identification

Text-independent verification means that speakers can speak in everyday language in enrollment and verification phases.

Text-dependent verification means that speakers need to choose the same passphrase to use during both enrollment and verification phases. This is the voice profile that should be used when configuring a voice profile for the app.

Speaker identification helps you determine an unknown speaker’s identity within a group of enrolled speakers.
