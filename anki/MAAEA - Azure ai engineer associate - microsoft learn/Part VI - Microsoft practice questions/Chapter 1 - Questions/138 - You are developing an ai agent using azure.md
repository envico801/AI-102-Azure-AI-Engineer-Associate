You need to configure the AI agent to interact effectively with external data sources.

What should you use?

========== Answer ==========

###### 1. Configure Azure AI Search.

Configuring Azure AI Search is the most appropriate solution because it provides indexing and querying capabilities that enable effective interaction with external data sources. Deploying a custom model in Azure Machine Learning is not suitable as it focuses on model deployment rather than facilitating external data source interaction. Using Azure AI Document Intelligence is not appropriate because it is designed for extracting structured data from documents, which does not align with the broader goal of data retrieval and analysis. Implementing Azure Bot Framework is ineffective in this context as it is intended for building conversational interfaces and does not address the need for data retrieval and analysis.
