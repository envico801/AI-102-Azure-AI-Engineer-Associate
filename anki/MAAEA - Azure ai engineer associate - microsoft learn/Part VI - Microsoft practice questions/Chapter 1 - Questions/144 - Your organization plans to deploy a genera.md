========== Question ==========  

### Your organization plans to deploy a generative AI solution using Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models with GPT-4 for natural language responses.

You need to ensure GPT-4 is available for inferencing via an endpoint.

Which three actions should you perform to achieve this goal? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

Select all answers that apply.

-   Create a new Azure subscription.

-   Deploy a GPT-4 model

-   Provision a Azure AI Foundry resource.

-   Select GPT-4 from the catalog.

-   Set up a virtual machine.

-   Use DALL-E.  

========== Answer ==========  

---

###### 1. Deploy a GPT-4 model

###### 2. Provision a Azure AI Foundry resource.

###### 3. Select GPT-4 from the catalog.

To deploy GPT-4 for inferencing, provisioning Azure AI Foundry resource is essential to establish the infrastructure. Selecting GPT-4 from the catalog ensures the correct model is chosen for the intended use case. Deploying GPT-4 to an endpoint makes it accessible for inferencing, completing the deployment process. Setting up a virtual machine is unnecessary because Azure AI Foundry uses managed endpoints. Creating a new Azure subscription is irrelevant if an existing subscription is available. Using DALL-E is incorrect because it is designed for image generation rather than natural language processing.
