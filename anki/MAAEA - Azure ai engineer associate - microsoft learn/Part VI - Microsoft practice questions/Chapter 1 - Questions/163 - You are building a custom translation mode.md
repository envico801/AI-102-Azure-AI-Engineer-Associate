========== Question ==========  

### You are building a custom translation model.

You need to evaluate the precision of the text that you translated by using a Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score.

Which scale is used for the score?

Select only one answer.

========== Answer ==========

###### 1. between 0 and 100

A BLEU score is a number between zero and 100. A score of zero indicates a low-quality translation, where nothing in the translation matches the reference. A score of 100 indicates a perfect translation that is identical to the reference. It is unnecessary to attain a score of 100. A BLEU score between 40 and 60 indicates a high-quality translation.
