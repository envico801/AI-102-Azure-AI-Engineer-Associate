========== Question ==========  

### Your company needs to analyze images of retail shelves to identify product placement and stock levels.

You need to implement a Microsoft Azure AI solution to analyze these images.

What should you use?

Select only one answer.

-   Use Azure AI Content Understanding.

-   Use an Azure AI Vision prebuilt model.

-   Use an Azure AI Foundry GPT model.  

========== Answer ==========

###### 1. Use Azure AI Content Understanding.

Azure AI Content Understanding is the most appropriate solution as it is specifically designed to analyze images and extract structured data, such as product counts, directly addressing the requirements. Training a Custom Vision model would require additional effort and resources without providing any significant advantage over the existing capabilities of Azure AI Content Understanding. Prebuilt Azure AI Vision models can detect bounding boxes but does not offer the ability to count or extract structured data about products, making it unsuitable for this task. Azure AI Foundry GPT models can provide information based on provided data or information but is unable to achieve the desired result on its own.
