###### 1. Use the Business Card model in Azure AI Document Intelligence.

The Business Card model in Azure AI Document Intelligence is the optimal choice for processing business cards due to its specialized capabilities for extracting structured data such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers. Training a custom model is unnecessary because the Business Card model already meets the requirements. Azure AI Vision OCR lacks the ability to extract structured data, making it unsuitable for this task. The Document model is designed for identity documents and does not provide the necessary functionality for processing business cards.
