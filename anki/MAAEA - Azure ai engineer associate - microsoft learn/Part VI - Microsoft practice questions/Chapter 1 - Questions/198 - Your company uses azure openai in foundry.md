========== Question ==========  

### Your company uses Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models to analyze large datasets.

You need to configure the application to retrieve relevant data efficiently.

What action should you take?

Select only one answer.

-   Deploy a GPT-4 model.

-   Enable vector search.

-   Increase chunk size.

-   Use keyword-based search.  

========== Answer ==========

###### 1. Enable vector search.

Enabling vector search enhances the relevance and efficiency of data retrieval, meeting the stated goal. Deploying an additional model does not address the need for efficient data retrieval, making it unsuitable. Increasing chunk size affects data processing but does not directly improve retrieval efficiency. Using keyword-based search lacks semantic capabilities, which are critical for achieving the desired outcome.
